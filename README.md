This calculator tool is created to help interactive designers/developers figure out camera's X , Y values based on Z value and vertical and horizontal angles.
It also calculated the corrected values of Y and Z after tilting the camera upward or downward.
In the Processing code, camera objects have mapValue for calculating the Z after tilting the camera. So, you can set mapValue to Z correction value calculated by this calculator.

Please let us know if you have any furthur question.

Good Luck!
