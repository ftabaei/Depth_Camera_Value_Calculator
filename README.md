This camera values calculator tool is created to help interactive designers/developers figure out camera's X , Y values based on Z (depth) value, vertical, and horizontal camera view angles.
It also calculates the corrected values of Y and Z after tilting the camera upward or downward.
In the Processing code, camera objects have mapValue for calculating the Z after tilting the camera. So, you can set mapValue to Z correction value calculated by this calculator.

Please let me know if you have any furthur questions.

Good Luck!
